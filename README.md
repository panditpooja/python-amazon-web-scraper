## 📝 Project Overview

This project uses Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape product details from Amazon and perform exploratory data analysis on the scraped data.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Extract product names, prices, ratings, and review counts.  
- Save scraped data into a clean CSV file for analysis.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon products.  
- Handle user-agent headers to bypass basic anti-scraping measures.  

💡 **Find Your User-Agent**  
To avoid request blocking, include your browser's user-agent string in headers. You can find it here: [https://httpbin.org/get](https://httpbin.org/get)
